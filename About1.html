                <br>
                <p> This website's main moto is to discourage bullying.
                    <br> One out of every five high school students reported being bullied at school and unfortunately I am one of those victim. I was helpless with my situations. I could't share to my parents neither my school counsellor. I felt like if I share my situation with any one they will judge me and even point out that it was my fault. I was physically, emotionally and socially torture everyday but i fought back to my worst nightmare and rise up again like PHOENIX. The reason behind this website is to help many peoples as i can went through liked mine. There is NO reason that a child should be bullied at all and especially to the point that they commit suicide. Everyone is different and to be different is o.k. To be a bully is pathetic and it's truly the coward's way. May we all stand up for those who are being bullied. May we ALL make a difference and stop it. In some small way let's change this. Let's make it stop and let's make this a better world.
